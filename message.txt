In order for your HOTTBOX LIVE service to continue, you must do an update. We have made many important changes and added or fixed some of the features available to our users, please take this opportunity to do this update and take advantage of all the benefits Hottbox has to offer! The Hottbox updater is located in the "programs" section, click on it and follow the on screen instructions. Remember to unplug your device when prompted otherwise the update won't stick!!!!
